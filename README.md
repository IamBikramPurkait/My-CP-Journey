| 1 | [When learning a new language, we first learn to output some message. Here, we'll start with the famous Hello World message. Now, here you are given a function to complete. Don't worry about the ins and outs of functions, just add the command (cout<<"Hello World") to print Hello World.](https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/start-coding/1)| [C++ Code](https://github.com/IamBikramPurkait/My-CP-Journey/blob/development/GFG/C%2B%2B%20BASIC/1%20-%20Introduction%2C%20Variables%20and%20Operators/Start_Coding.cpp)|
| 2 | [You are familiar with producing output using C++/C. In this task, you'll be required to write three messages in three separate lines. Write Geeks for Geeks. But wait a minute!! You need to write each word of it in a separate line.](https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/the-new-line/1) | [C++ Code](https://github.com/IamBikramPurkait/My-CP-Journey/blob/development/GFG/C%2B%2B%20BASIC/1%20-%20Introduction%2C%20Variables%20and%20Operators/The_new_line.cpp) |  
| 3 | [Comments are very useful in any language to tell a user what is the task of any function or operation. The comments are neglected by the compiler, so whatever you write in the comments won't have any effect on the working of a code. In C/C++, comments can be written as mentioned below:/*This is a comment*/ //This is also a comment](https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/learn-to-comment/1) | [C++ Code](https://github.com/IamBikramPurkait/My-CP-Journey/blob/development/GFG/C%2B%2B%20BASIC/1%20-%20Introduction%2C%20Variables%20and%20Operators/learn_new_comment.cpp) | 
| 4 | [Working with Data Types is very important in the programming world. Here, we will learn to manipulate the basic data types in CPP.You will be given four different variables of different data types: a (int), b (float), c (double), l (long long), d (string). Your task is to do step-wise operations as given below:1. Divide b by c.2. Divide b by a.3. Divide c by a (cast to int).4. Add result of step 3 with l.5. Print the given string, and the 4th (0-based indexing) character of the string both separated by a space.](https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/data-types/1) | [C++ Code](https://github.com/IamBikramPurkait/My-CP-Journey/blob/development/GFG/C%2B%2B%20BASIC/1%20-%20Introduction%2C%20Variables%20and%20Operators/datatypes.cpp) | 
| 5 | [There are times when your answer is a floating point that contains undesired amount of digits after decimal. Here, we'll learn how to get a precise answer out of a floating number. You are given two floating numbers a and b. You need to output a/b and decimal precision of a/b upto 3 places after the decimal point.Note: You may use setprecision and fixed.](https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/learning-to-be-precise/1) | [C++ Code](https://github.com/IamBikramPurkait/My-CP-Journey/blob/development/GFG/C%2B%2B%20BASIC/1%20-%20Introduction%2C%20Variables%20and%20Operators/learning_to_be_precise.cpp) | 
| 6 | [Macro is one of the most important part of CPP preprocessors. It allows us to define variables and functions and it basically works by substituting the value or function during the preprocessing stage of code conversion(High level to Low level). So, let's dive into preprocessors!You are given two inputs: a(integer),and b(integer). You need to print a * b .](https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/learning-macros/1) | [C++ Code](https://github.com/IamBikramPurkait/My-CP-Journey/blob/development/GFG/C%2B%2B%20BASIC/1%20-%20Introduction%2C%20Variables%20and%20Operators/learning_macros.cpp) | 
| 7 | [Given two numbers a and b, you need to swap their values so a holds the value of b and b holds the value of a.](https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/swap-the-numbers/0/?track=cip-intro-var-operators&batchId=238) | [C++ Code](https://github.com/IamBikramPurkait/My-CP-Journey/blob/development/GFG/C%2B%2B%20BASIC/1%20-%20Introduction%2C%20Variables%20and%20Operators/swap_the_numbers.cpp) | 
| 8 | [Given a double value d, typecast it to an integer value.](https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/type-conversion/0/?track=cip-intro-var-operators&batchId=238) | [C++ Code](https://github.com/IamBikramPurkait/My-CP-Journey/blob/development/GFG/C%2B%2B%20BASIC/1%20-%20Introduction%2C%20Variables%20and%20Operators/type_conversion.cpp) | 
| 9 | [Given a variable value  return the size of the variable. It can be of any data type like int, float, char, double, etc.](https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/315289330d2c89ab5d2430c9f2434a8b9ae13ab0/0/?track=cip-intro-var-operators&batchId=238) | [C++ Code](https://github.com/IamBikramPurkait/My-CP-Journey/blob/development/GFG/C%2B%2B%20BASIC/1%20-%20Introduction%2C%20Variables%20and%20Operators/return_size.cpp) | 
| 10 | [Given 2 integers a and b. Find the value of a/b, where b is not equal to zero. After computation the answer should be in double format with precised value.](https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/db4b6dd5adab4810359001fffaf0fdc2587cf060/0/?track=cip-intro-var-operators&batchId=238) | [C++ Code](https://github.com/IamBikramPurkait/My-CP-Journey/blob/development/GFG/C%2B%2B%20BASIC/1%20-%20Introduction%2C%20Variables%20and%20Operators/compute_abyb.cpp) |
