| 1 | [Pooja would like to withdraw X $US from an ATM. The cash machine will only accept the transaction if X is a multiple of 5, and Pooja's account balance has enough cash to perform the withdrawal transaction (including bank charges). For each successful withdrawal the bank charges 0.50 $US. Calculate Pooja's account balance after an attempted transaction.](https://www.codechef.com/problems/HS08TEST)| [C++ Code](https://github.com/IamBikramPurkait/My-CP-Journey/blob/main/Codechef/atm.cpp)|
| 2 | [The purpose of this problem is to verify whether the method you are using to read input data is sufficiently fast to handle problems branded with the enormous Input/Output warning. You are expected to be able to process at least 2.5MB of input data per second at runtime.](https://www.codechef.com/problems/INTEST)| [C++ Code](https://github.com/IamBikramPurkait/My-CP-Journey/blob/main/Codechef/enourmous_input_test.cpp)|
| 3 | [Two integers A and B are the inputs. Write a program to find GCD and LCM of A and B.](https://www.codechef.com/problems/FLOW016)| [C++ Code](https://github.com/IamBikramPurkait/My-CP-Journey/blob/main/Codechef/gcd_lcm.cpp)|
| 4 | [Three numbers A, B and C are the inputs. Write a program to find second largest among them.](https://www.codechef.com/problems/FLOW017)| [C++ Code](https://github.com/IamBikramPurkait/My-CP-Journey/blob/main/Codechef/second_largest.cpp)|

| 7 | [Kattapa, as you all know was one of the greatest warriors of his time. The kingdom of Maahishmati had never lost a battle under him (as army-chief), and the reason for that was their really powerful army, also called as Mahasena.Kattapa was known to be a very superstitious person. He believed that a soldier is "lucky" if the soldier is holding an even number of weapons, and "unlucky" otherwise. He considered the army as "READY FOR BATTLE" if the count of "lucky" soldiers is strictly greater than the count of "unlucky" soldiers, and "NOT READY" otherwise.Given the number of weapons each soldier is holding, your task is to determine whether the army formed by all these soldiers is "READY FOR BATTLE" or "NOT READY".](https://www.codechef.com/problems/AMR15A)| [C++ Code](https://github.com/IamBikramPurkait/My-CP-Journey/blob/main/Codechef/Beginner/mahasena.cpp)|
