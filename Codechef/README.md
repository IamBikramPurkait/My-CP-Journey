| 1 | [Pooja would like to withdraw X $US from an ATM. The cash machine will only accept the transaction if X is a multiple of 5, and Pooja's account balance has enough cash to perform the withdrawal transaction (including bank charges). For each successful withdrawal the bank charges 0.50 $US. Calculate Pooja's account balance after an attempted transaction.](https://www.codechef.com/problems/HS08TEST)| [C++ Code](https://github.com/IamBikramPurkait/My-CP-Journey/blob/main/Codechef/Beginner/atm.cpp)|

| 7 | [Kattapa, as you all know was one of the greatest warriors of his time. The kingdom of Maahishmati had never lost a battle under him (as army-chief), and the reason for that was their really powerful army, also called as Mahasena.Kattapa was known to be a very superstitious person. He believed that a soldier is "lucky" if the soldier is holding an even number of weapons, and "unlucky" otherwise. He considered the army as "READY FOR BATTLE" if the count of "lucky" soldiers is strictly greater than the count of "unlucky" soldiers, and "NOT READY" otherwise.Given the number of weapons each soldier is holding, your task is to determine whether the army formed by all these soldiers is "READY FOR BATTLE" or "NOT READY".](https://www.codechef.com/problems/AMR15A)| [C++ Code](https://github.com/IamBikramPurkait/My-CP-Journey/blob/main/Codechef/Beginner/mahasena.cpp)|

| 1 | [Suppose for a unit rise in temperature, the solubility of sugar in water increases by Bg100 mL.Chef does an experiment to check how much sugar (in g) he can dissolve given that he initially has 1 liter of water at X degrees and the solubility of sugar at this temperature is Ag100 mL. Also, Chef doesn't want to lose any water so he can increase the temperature to at most 100 degrees.Assuming no loss of water takes place during the process, find the maximum amount of sugar (in g) can be dissolved in 1 liter of water under the given conditions.](https://www.codechef.com/MAY21C/problems/SOLBLTY)| [C++ Code](https://github.com/IamBikramPurkait/My-CP-Journey/blob/main/Codechef/Contest/May%20Challenge%202021%20Div%203/SOLBLTY/SOLBLTY.cpp)|
| 2 | [It's a lockdown. You’re bored in your house and are playing golf in the hallway.The hallway has N+2 tiles numbered from 0 to N+1 from left to right. There is a hole on tile number x. You hit the ball standing on tile 0. When you hit the ball, it bounces at lengths of k, i.e. the tiles covered by it are 0,k,2k,…, and so on until the ball passes tile N+1.If the ball doesn't enter the hole in the first trial, you try again but this time standing on the tile N+1. When you hit the ball, it bounces at lengths of k, i.e. the tiles covered by it are (N+1),(N+1−k),(N+1−2k),…, and so on until the ball passes tile 0.Find if the ball will enter the hole, either in its forward journey or backward journey.Note: The input and output of this problem are large, so prefer using fast input/output methods.](https://www.codechef.com/MAY21C/problems/LKDNGOLF)| [C++ Code](https://github.com/IamBikramPurkait/My-CP-Journey/blob/main/Codechef/Contest/May%20Challenge%202021%20Div%203/LKDNGOLF/LKDNGOLF.cpp)|
| 3 | [For a given N, find the number of ways to choose an integer x from the range [0,2N−1] such that x⊕(x+1)=(x+2)⊕(x+3), where ⊕ denotes the bitwise XOR operator.Since the number of valid x can be large, output it modulo 109+7.](https://www.codechef.com/MAY21C/problems/XOREQUAL)| [C++ Code](https://github.com/IamBikramPurkait/My-CP-Journey/blob/main/Codechef/Contest/May%20Challenge%202021%20Div%203/XOREQUAL/XOREQUAL.cpp)|
| 4 | [Tic-tac-toe is a game played between two players on a 3×3 grid. In a turn, a player chooses an empty cell and places their symbol on the cell. The players take alternating turns, where the player with the first turn uses the symbol X and the other player uses the symbol O. The game continues until there is a row, column, or diagonal containing three of the same symbol (X or O), and the player with that token is declared the winner. Otherwise if every cell of the grid contains a symbol and nobody won, then the game ends and it is considered a draw.](https://www.codechef.com/MAY21C/problems/TCTCTOE)| [C++ Code](https://github.com/IamBikramPurkait/My-CP-Journey/blob/main/Codechef/Contest/May%20Challenge%202021%20Div%203/TCTCTOE/TCTCTOE.cpp)|

| 6 | [Zanka finds fun in everyday simple things. One fine day he got interested in a very trivial sequence. Given a natural number k, he considers the sequence Ai=k+i2 so that the terms arek+1,k+4,k+9,k+16,…Now to make things more interesting, he considers the gcd of consecutive terms in the sequence, then takes the sum of the first 2k values. More formally, he wants to compute∑i=12kgcd(Ai,Ai+1)Denote this sum by S. Zanka wants you to print the number S for each k.](https://www.codechef.com/MAY21C/problems/ISS)| [C++ Code](https://github.com/IamBikramPurkait/My-CP-Journey/blob/main/Codechef/Contest/May%20Challenge%202021%20Div%203/ISS/ISS.cpp)|
